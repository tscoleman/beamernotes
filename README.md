# beamernotes
Example for Beamer Slides + Notes, to print EITHER Slides or Slides+Notes
## Beamer Notes+Slides Summary
This is a sample Beamer presentation that combines _Presentation Slides_ with _Textual Notes_ in a single file which can be printed as either

**Presentation-ready Slides**
* Slides Only

**Notes + Slides**
* Notes interlaced with slides
* Slides formatted, displayed, and demarcated
* All formatted for printing in a reasonably compact format
### Sample Output
You can view the sample output in the two included pdfs:
* Slides: _BeamerNotes_slides.pdf_
* Notes+Slides: _BeamerNotes_notes.pdf_
### Latex source file
* raw latex: _BeamerNotes_slides.tex_
* * You need to comment / uncomment lines to print as slides versus notes
### Lyx source files
The set-up for Lyx is particularly simple, and I have included both
* Main file (source & printing slides): _BeamerNotes_slides.lyx_
* Ancillary file for printing notes: _BeamerNotes_notes.lyx_
